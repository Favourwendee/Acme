# Acme
Data Analysis Project 2: Using Python

The main goal of this project is to answer the critical business question: Is it worthwhile for ACME to introduce a new budget tablet in 2023, built upon the 6th generation chipset? To answer this, we must consider various factors, such as sales trends, model lifespans, and pricing strategies.

We'll examine how long previous tablet models stayed on the market and their sales performance over time. Additionally, we'll analyze pricing information to understand customer preferences and market competitiveness.

By delving into this data, ACME aims to make an informed decision to help them stay competitive and meet customer demands effectively. The analysis will guide ACME in deciding whether to proceed with the 6th-generation chipset budget tablet launch in 2023, ensuring it aligns with their business goals and marketÂ dynamics.
